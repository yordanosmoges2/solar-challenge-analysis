Solar Challenge – Week 0

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and initial preparation for solar radiation data.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes solar radiation trends for several countries to understand patterns and prepare the dataset for further modeling in upcoming challenge weeks.

Countries analyzed:

Benin

Togo

Sierra Leone

Compare all countries together

Each country includes:

Data cleaning

Handling missing values

Visualization of radiation trends

Saving cleaned datasets
